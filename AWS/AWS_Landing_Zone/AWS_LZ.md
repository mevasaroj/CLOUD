# AWS Landing Zone
 - A landing zone is a well-architected, multi-account AWS environment that is scalable and secure.
 - It provides a baseline to get started with multi-account architecture, identity and access management, governance, data security, network design, and logging.
 - AWS offers its Control Tower service, which functions as a landing zone as a service.
 - AWS Control Tower automates the setup of a new landing zone using best-practices blueprints for identity, federated access, and account structure.
